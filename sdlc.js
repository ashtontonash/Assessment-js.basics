// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofRequirements = "The next step is to see what kind of application or strings of code would need to be run in order for the code to meet the desired outcome."
const design = "Different aspects of the program such as UI, platforms, and security- among other things- must be modeled in order to start putting together the structure of the project."
const implementation = "The part where you start writing your script based off of your planning and design vision."
const testingIntegration = "An important phase in which you fine tune and test all the different parts of our code to make it available to users."
const maintain = "The program will grow as more people use it, so there are bound to be problems. This is where you continue updating your code to make it more user friendly, and get rid of any glitches or bugs along the way."
